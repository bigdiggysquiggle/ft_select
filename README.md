This project was intended to introduce us to TermCaps and make us explore how they work by having us utilize them to create a basic program with a rudimentary GUI, of course written in C so that we build a strong understanding of what exactly is happening when you use a TermCaps based program. The program is meant to take in any given amount of paramters, show the user a grid of the given parameters, allow the user to select/deselect any of them, and upon completion it prints out only the selected options from the input list. The idea being that this could be a between program in a shell script or something where you may want to manually control what part of one program's output gets sent to the next program's input.
